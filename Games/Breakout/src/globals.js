/**
 * The state machine we'll be using to transition between various states
 * in our game instead of clumping them together in our update and draw methods.
 *
 * Current game state can be any of the following:
 *   1. 'title-screen' (the beginning of the game, where we're told to press Enter)
 *   2. 'play' (the ball is in play, bouncing between paddles)
 *   3. 'serve' (waiting on a key press to serve the ball)
 *   4. 'game-over' (the player has lost; display score and allow restart)
 *   5. 'victory' (the current level is over, with a victory jingle)
 *   6. 'high-score' (displays all the high scores)
 *   7. 'enter-high-score' (player got a high score and can enter their name)
 *   8. 'paddle-select' (the player can select a skin for their paddle before playing)
