    <h3>Visual Basic</h3>
     <p> Before ever even considering programming as a career path,
       I learned a bit of visual basics. I followed a tutorial to make
       popups. With this new learned skill, I went mad with power.<br><br>
       The next day at school, I made a popup and pretended it was a virus.  
       I then created a giant choose your own
       adventure story with these pop ups and from there I knew I wanted to learn more.

     <h3>Game design</h3>
     <p>I have spent countless hours watching my brother play video games. Since being always 
       the back seat driver the psychology and design behind video games had always been more
        interesting then the game itself. How to make a game challenging but still engaging or 
        making puzzles. A great Youtube channel I recommend watching is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/McBacon1337">Game Makerâ€™s Toolkit.</a>

      <h3>Riddles and Logic Problems</h3>
      <p>
        A logical puzzle is a problem that can be solved through deductive reasoning.Watching
         riddles/logic problem videos and playing games like sudoku / minesweeper is something 
         I can do for hours on end. In programming you often encounter problems that are reasoning based.
